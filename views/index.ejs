          <p>Peak Response is an open source software system that provides EMS professionals with simple documentation, powerful sorting, and streamlined analysis capabilities that fit into the workflow of complex MCIs.</p>
          <p>As first responders collect patient data across a scene, each new piece of information is automatically uploaded to provide a live bird’s-eye view for the incident commander and others managing the scene strategy. Peak Response also allows for easy data transfer to receiving hospitals, creating a foundation for improved continuation of care.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <h3>Dedicated to providing life saving efficiency.</h3>
      <p>Peak Response (originally NaTriage) was initially conceptualized in 2019 as part of the Tech to Protect Challenge, sponsored by NIST PSCR, aimed at fostering technological innovation for emergency responders. The solution came out of a focus on a common pain point: time spent documenting injuries and incidents at the scene of mass casualty incidents. These incidents are chaotic, high-pressure environments where time spent documenting can mean the difference between life and death. The quick tag scan and speech-to-text form filling were the first features, but the solution quickly expanded to include a variety of powerful sorting and data export options to improve efficiency, both at the point of contact with the patient and also for the incident commander monitoring the entire scene.</p>
      <p>We are working to release an improved and expanded version of the software in the fall of 2020 that will include improved feature set and designs.</p>
